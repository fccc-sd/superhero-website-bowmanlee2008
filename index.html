<h2>background of Batgirl, Batman, Robin,  and Nightwing </h2>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Batman adopted Robin so Roben is Batmans son 
who is later Nightwing and then his biological son becomes the new Robin.  
Batman has had his adopted son and his biological son. 
Batgirl is Batmans protege and has train 2 of her own sudents. 
Nightwing is a full fledged hero by the time the new Robin is been broght in to the crime fighting team. 
The reasons I picked the Batfam is because of how the can take down villains. 
I like the ways they can stop crime on matter how far way the crime is happening from them.
</P>
<h3>The villians the Batfamily protects Gothum city from</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Batman, Batgirl, Nightwing, and Robin all defend Gothum city from the
Riddiler who leads, Two Face, Clay Face, Possion Ivy, Mr. Freeze and they all want to steal all of Gotham cities gold.
The Penguin who leads, Catwoman, Bane, Man Bat and Killer Croc and they all want to attact and to rob the citizens of Gotham city. 
and The Jocker who leads, Harlly Quien, mad Hatter, Scarcrow, and Killer Moth and they all want to possion Gotham city with laphing gas.
So their is a total of <em>14 villains</em> in all the bat family have to deal with nightly to keep Gotham city safe from.
