As for The Penguin, Catwoman (occasionally, but also appears in Arkham), The Riddler (when deemed sane enough for trial), 
Deadshot (sometimes sent to Belle Reve, but also appears here), Bane (has been held in both Arkham and Blackgate), 
and Mob bosses and common thugs are all held in Blackgate Penitentiary. 
So the total from the first page is now <em>17 villians</em> 
that the bat _family has to deal with nightly or when ever they braek out.
