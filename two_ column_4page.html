<p>
The Arkham Asylum is a prisson were Batman holds his insaen villains. 
Sometime there are other villains that are held in Arkham Asylum are villians such as The Joker, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, 
Two-Face, Riddler, Victor Zsasz, Mad Hatter, Clay Face, Man Bat, Killer Moth, and Catwoman who occasionally but also appears in Arkham.
As for Mr. Freeze who is held in Arkham not because he is insane but because it is the one place that has a cryo-cell for him to continue
living and not die. Killer Croc who is often in a specialized habitat.
</p>
<br> 
<h4>&nbsp; the Blackgate_Penitentiary prisson</h4>
<img src="images/Blackgate_Penitentiary_.jpg" alt="a prisson for supervillains" height="230" width="265">
<p>
Blackgate Penitentiary is a prisson for the sane villians. The villians that are held there are Penguin, Catwoman,
The Riddler when deemed sane enough for trial, Deadshot sometimes sent to Belle Reve, but also appears in Blackgate,
Bane who has been held in both Arkham and Blackgate prissons, and the Mob bosses and common thugs.
</p>
<br>
;&nbsp;Batman, Batgirl, Nightwing, and Robin all defend Gothum city from the
Riddiler who leads, Two Face, Clay Face, Possion Ivy, Mr. Freeze and they all want to steal all of Gotham cities gold.
The Penguin who leads, Catwoman, Bane, Man Bat and Killer Croc and they all want to attact and to rob the citizens of Gotham city. 
and The Jocker who leads, Harlly Quien, mad Hatter, Scarcrow, and Killer Moth and they all want to possion Gotham city with laphing gas.
So their is a total of <em>14 villains</em> in all the bat family have to deal with nightly to keep Gotham city safe from. 
</p>
<br>
&nbsp;Batman adopted Robin so Roben is Batmans son 
who is later Nightwing and then his biological son becomes the new Robin.  
Batman has had his adopted son and his biological son. 
Batgirl is Batmans protege and has train 2 of her own sudents. 
Nightwing is a full fledged hero by the time the new Robin is been broght in to the crime fighting team. 
The reasons I picked the Batfam is because of how the can take down villains. 
I like the ways they can stop crime on matter how far way the crime is happening from them.
